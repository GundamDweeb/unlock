The Unlock Protocol has been deployed to the [Base L2 üîµ](https://docs.base.org/)! Our goal at Unlock has always been to support any ecosystem where developers, event organizers, creators, or brands want to deploy **their** membership contracts.

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/home) (one of our investors) has undeniably contributed massively to the crypto ecosystem, and we believe Base represents a step in democratizing web3 and the onchain web.

As an L2, Base benefits from the ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù budget of Ethereum, while also lowering transaction costs.

## How does it work?

Deploying a membership contract to Base follows the same process as deploying to any other of networks supported by Unlock Protocol. You can deploy your lock(s) using the Unlock Protocol Dashboard (or do it through code) and then use any of the tools available in the Unlock Protocol ecosystem, including using our checkout to sell your NFT memberships, airdrop them, or tap into any of the other capabilities available to the community.
